  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
      - family: Yekan
        fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Yekan.ttf
      - family: shaded-larch
        fonts:
          - asset: fonts/shaded-larch.ttf
